# 3D Game Using React Three Fiber (three js)
I'm tired of that game ad so I am building the game myself (in my free time)

# Core functions
- you can move the player
- you can shoot and kill enemies
- both bullets and enemeis disappear on collision
- map is constantly generated as you move (platforms behind you are also removed when they're out of the scene)

# Test
